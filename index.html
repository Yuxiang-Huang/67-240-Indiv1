    <!-- For this assignment, I chose to focus on my favorite on-campus dining
      locations in CMU. I got the chance to try most of the food options in CMU
      over the first two weeks of the semester. The theme of my website will
      include a ranking of my favorite on-campus dining locations with pictures
      and a form for you to submit your opinion on the CMU dining options. I
      will also include a table to provide food recommendations for each of my
      favorite dining locations, as well as another page featuring maps for the
      three biggest dining buildings in CMU. -->
